DATASET CONSTRUCTION
====================
There are 956 video sequences in this dataset. These have been generated from 239 unique 4k (3840x2176 px) source sequences.
The 4k sequences have been spatially down-sampled to three other resolutions: 1920x1088 px, 960x544 px, and 480x272 px. (Please
note that that vertical resolution has been intentionally made to be a multiple of 64.) Down-sampling was performed using the
Lanczos-3 filter. The implementation of the filter was taken from AVM's (AOM Video Model) GitLab repository. Specifically,
we used the code at tag "research-v3.1.0" found under the following link: https://gitlab.com/AOMediaCodec/avm/-/tree/research-v3.1.0/tools/lanczos.

Each sequence in the dataset has a filename generated using the following file naming convention:
    <R><sequence_name>_<width>x<height>_<framerate>fps_<bit_depth>bit_<chroma_sampling>,

where <R> is a single letter corresponding to a resolution class: A (3840x2176 px), B (1920x1088 px), C (960x544 px), and D (480x272 px);
<sequence_name> is an alphanumeric sequence identifing a given source sequence (e.g., MidnightSun);
<width> and <height> represent video width and height in pixels (e.g., 480x272);
<framerate> corresponds to source video's framerate (e.g., 50);
<bit_depth> represents video's bit depth (10 for all videos in this dataset);
<chroma_sampling> identifies what chroma sampling scheme is used (420 for all videos in this dataset).

Importantly, each sequence in this dataset is 64-frame long and does NOT contain any scene cuts. This means that most sequences in this
dataset have been generated by extracting 64-frame long fragments from longer sequences.

All sequences in this dataset have been losslessly compressed using the h.264 codec. Please use FFmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/) to
extract raw video data from each file. See below for an example FFmpeg call:

    $ ffmpeg.exe -i DAncientThoughtS14_480x272_24fps_10bit_420_x264_compressed.mkv DAncientThoughtS14_480x272_24fps_10bit_420_x264_compressed.yuv
